            <h1> IsoTex: Creating Isotypes as Documents with a Declarative Markup Language </h1>
            <p>
               This paper contributes IsoTex, a new declarative markup language for creating isotypes.  Isotypes are an omnipresent form of visualization favored by designers to communicate data to a large audience via series of pictorial representations or icons. IsoTex makes isotype creation akin to textual document preparation in LaTeX.  Coupled with an interactive editor, IsoTex enable designers to explore a large range of design alternatives via live editing or direct manipulation. Users can experiment with different data units and layouts in the language, immediately reflected in the editor; or rapidly skim through alternative icons, adjusting their aspect ratio and spacing in the editor, immediately added to the syntax. The light-weight version history supports design experimentation while the textual specification facilitates design reuse. Feedback from users suggests that IsoTex facilitates design explorations compared to graphical editors while offering a lower learning curve than programming. 
Our main contribution is the novel language proposing a transfer of the latex-style paradigm to the context of isotypes using the document/sentence/char paradigm. Thanks to our bi-directional interface (which is a secondary contribution), we provide to a large audience a tool for the flexible and easy design of isotypes.
